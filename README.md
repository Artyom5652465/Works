# Works
There is a collection of my projects
1) The folder GameClub contains a project that simulates the work of computer club. The language - C#. The OOP principles were applied.
2) The folder ChessCruhs includes the demo version of the game with some screenshots of the future game. 
The main aim of the game is to push all enemy chess pieces off the board. There will be some levels that some of them you can see on the photos.
